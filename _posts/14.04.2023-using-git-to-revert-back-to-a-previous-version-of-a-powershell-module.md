# Using git to revert back to an earlier version of a powershell module

- 1 find the commit ID of your change, and copy it.
- 2 re-apply the code
- 3 Push code back up

## 1 Find the commit ID

In order to find the commit to which you want to revert back, you can use the following query:

```git
git reflog
```

In the next steps, the ID is refered as **commitid-you-want-to-go-back-to**

> Alternativley, you could also use ```git log``` but frankly I cannot find anything in that view. So really, just use ```git reflog```

## 2 Re-apply the code

Use ```git reset --hard commitid-you-want-to-go-back-to```

## 3 push code back

You will most likley need to push your code back online / on your code hosting tool. To do so, you will mostley get denied if to push, mentionning that your code is behind.

You will have to force using the following command:

```git push --force```
